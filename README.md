# ycron: Lightweight YAML-based Cronjob Management

## Overview

ycron (YAML + Cronjob) is a Python-based system for managing scheduled tasks. It provides enhanced monitoring, failure handling, and control over your cronjobs through simple YAML configuration.

**Why ycron?** Traditional cron lacks centralized visibility and robust error handling. ycron addresses this by offering a web interface for tracking job execution, managing retries, and backfilling missed runs. It's designed to be **significantly lighter than full-fledged orchestrators like Apache Airflow**, making it ideal for projects that need more than basic cron but don't require complex data pipeline management.

## Key Features

*   **YAML Configuration:** Define jobs, schedules (cron-like), retry policies, and backfill behavior in human-readable YAML files.
*   **Reliable Execution:** Automatic retries for transient failures and backfill for missed job runs (e.g., system downtime).
*   **Web Interface:** Centralized dashboard for:
    *   Monitoring job status and execution history.
    *   Manually triggering jobs.
    *   Filtering execution logs by job.
*   **Concurrency Control:** Limit parallel runs for individual jobs (`max_parallel`).
*   **SQLite Persistence:** Job definitions and execution history are stored locally.
